/**
 * What an agent's shell commands did to the project's files.
 *
 * An ACP agent reports a diff for its own file tools, but a command that
 * writes a file — Codex's `exec_command`, Claude's Bash, a formatter — is just
 * a command to the protocol. To show those changes too, the working tree is
 * snapshotted with git and compared around each command.
 *
 * A snapshot is a tree object written through an index of NekoCode's own
 * (`GIT_INDEX_FILE`), seeded from the repository's so unchanged files are not
 * hashed again. The user's index, refs and working tree are never touched; the
 * only trace is loose objects, which git collects as it does any other.
